# linux-onedrive-backup webapp

A tool that can be used to compare SHA1 hashes computed locally and by OneDrive to verify
that the encrypted files were stored properly.


## Setup

1. Use your MS Live login and register an app as per the instructions at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2

1. Setup the app permissions and redirect URI

1. Note down the following values for your app:
   * App/ Client Id
   * App/ Client Secret
   * Tenant Id

1. Clone this repository:

   `$ git clone https://github.com/shreepads/linux-onedrive-backup.git`
   
1. cd into the directory, create a Python 3 virtual environment and activate it:

   `$ cd linux-onedrive-backup`
   
   `$ python3 -m venv venv`
   
   `$ source venv/bin/activate`
   
1. Install the requirements

   `(venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
   

## Run

1. cd into the webapp/ folder and check the virtual environment is active

1. Setup the App/ Client Id, App/ Client Secret and Tenant Id as environment variables

   `(venv)$ read CLIENT_ID`
   
   `(venv)$ read CLIENT_SECRET`
   
   `(venv)$ read TENANT_ID`
   
   `(venv)$ export CLIENT_ID CLIENT_SECRET TENANT_ID`
   
1. Run the webapp

   `(venv)$ flask run --port 5000`
   
1. Open in browser as http://localhost:5000 (don't use the IP based URL output by Flask)

1. Click on the 'Sign In' link. Sign-in and provide consent for your app to access your
   MS Live account details (only needed the first time)

1. Click on the 'OneDrive files' link and subsequent links to navigate to the folder where
   the split gpg files are stored

1. The app displays the SHA1 hashes (generated by OneDrive and stored in the file object
   metadata) and filenames of all files in the folder
   
1. Copy and save the information (hash filename pairs) to a .txt file

1. Compare the SHA1 hashes reported from OneDrive with those generated in Step 3 of the Backup
   process (documented in the main README)

   `git diff onedrive-important-2020-03-30-sha1s.txt split-gpg-sha1sums-important-2020-03-30.txt`
